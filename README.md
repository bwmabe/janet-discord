# janet-discord
a discord bot for me and my friends

I made this bot to hangout in private servers with friends. Thus, a good portion of the commands are related to that

This a NodeJS rewrite of the bot since `discord.py` is no longer maintained

## Ideas for the Bot
	* Change trout-slap to use a file
	* Finish the random file thing
	* **LOGGER!**
	* Dynamically add new commands without restarting the bot?
	* Find my *\*bonk\* go to horny jail* images
	* Add the cutebot
	* Create an `async` method in [rand-apod](https://github.com/bwmabe/rand-apod) and add it as a `Cog`
	* Maybe add other kinds of reaction images???
	* Integrate the Garnet Bot?
	* Salvage my old NodeJS bots?
