a discord bot for me and my friends

I made this bot to hangout in private servers with friends. Thus, a good portion of the commands are related to that

This is a TypeScript rewrite of theNodeJS rewrite of the bot that I made because `discord.py` is no longer maintained.

I decided to rewrite the bot in TypeScript because that's what I use at work and I want to get more familair with it.

## Ideas for the Bot
* **LOGGER!**
* Dynamically add new commands without restarting the bot?
* Find my *\*bonk\* go to horny jail* images
* Create a method that works with NodeJS in [rand-apod](https://github.com/bwmabe/rand-apod) and add it
* Maybe add other kinds of reaction images???
* Integrate the Garnet Bot?
* Salvage the old bots
* ImageMagick?
